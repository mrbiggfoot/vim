# vim + fuzzy completion
This is a [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) fork that enables fuzzy
search on completion candidates by the virtue of slightly modified
[fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy). All you need to do is
`set completeopt+=fuzzy` and trigger completion popup somehow (I personally use
[mucomplete](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-mucomplete) plugin for that).

Some time ago I made a similar `neovim` fork, look
[here](https://github.com/mrbiggfoot/neovim) for more info. But then fixing
`neovim` bugs became annoying and I decided to give `vim` a shot again. So here
you go. As usual, I'm not responsible for any damage you can cause or suffer
from during this fork usage.
